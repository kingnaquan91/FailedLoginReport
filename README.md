# FailedLoginReport
Challenge 2 of Infrastructure Developer Training - Failed Login Report
Challenge 2 - JavaScript Programming Basics

BACKGROUND
In this exercise, you will read in 2 data files, one with user login attempts from a web server, and another file with employee data.  These files represent data sources that might come from a file, or can possibly be sources from other types of repositories like a database.

OBJECTIVE
Your job is to create 2 reports: 
	1) A report of failed login attempts with the details of those records
	2) A report that summarizes each login that had an error with a count of the number of errors for each employee
	3) BONUS: produce JSON output from the full login records data file (Google it!)

SETUP
You will receive 8 files (in addition to these instructions):
	1) A Challenge 2 HTML file
	2) An employee data file
	3) A web server login log file
	4) The starter Challenge 2 JavaScript file with some code and pseudocode you will use to get started
	5) A solution to the exercise
	6) 3 JPG files with the sample report output

Try to provide the missing pieces of the program from the starter file (challenge2_script.js).  If you are spending too much time, or simply want to peek at the solution, you can, but more importantly, try to understand exactly what it does, line by line.  We will go over this in either the next or the following workshop.

There are many ways to do any and all of the tasks here. Think and be creative. The more time you spend on figuring something out, the more you will learn. Take your time and you will learn a lot.


GETTING STARTED
1) Create a folder on your drive for the exercise.
2) Copy and extract the contents of the exercise zip file.
3) Open up a new Firefox browser window
4) From the File menu, choose Open File... and navigate to your folder, opening the Challenge2.html
5) Select F12 to open the Console window
6) Select Shift-F4 to open Scratchpad
7) In Scratchpad, select Open File... and open the starter file, challenge2_script.js.

HINT: Start after the **MAIN** section of the program.  Add the function logic at the top as you come to need those functions.
HINT2: It may be helpful to either Google code if you are not sure how to do something, or go to https://www.w3schools.com/js/ for a really good JavaScript reference.
HINT3: Since Scratchpad is not a full featured editor, you should use Console.log() in strategic places while programming to know what variable or array values are being referenced at that point in your code.


GOOD LUCK!
